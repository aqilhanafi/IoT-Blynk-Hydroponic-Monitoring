# Enhanced Edge Processing with IoT Based Integrated Hydroponic System

Enhanced Edge Processing with IoT Based Integrated Hydroponic System using Blynk is an innovative approach that combines the power of IoT technology and hydroponics. By leveraging the capabilities of the Blynk platform, this system enables advanced monitoring and control of a hydroponic setup. Through the Blynk mobile application, users can remotely access and manage crucial parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH levels, nutrient concentration, and lighting conditions in real-time. The system also offers automation features, allowing tasks like nutrient dosing and light scheduling to be programmed and executed automatically. This integration optimizes the efficiency, accuracy, and convenience of hydroponic cultivation, leading to improved plant growth, higher yields, and a more sustainable farming approach.
